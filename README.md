# chrome-next-tab

How often have you opened a new tab in Chrome to look something up quickly, and cursed when Chrome opens it at the end of all open tabs? Happens to
 the best of us.

# Get started

- Go to `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome and enable `Developer mode` on the top right
- Click on `Load unpacked` in the top left and navigate to where you `git clone`'d  in the first step and add it.
- That's it!
